Hey there! Welcome to [**Episode 2**](https://www.youtube.com/katalystkat) of our nutritional science podcast! 

Last episode, we established a foundational overview of the various types of research studies compeleted by scientists to examine hypotheses! At the apex of the pyramid of scientific evidence (if you don't know what I'm talking about, [go brush up your knowledge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhqagKe7qwo&t=2941s)), there exists systematic reviews where well-conducted randomized controlled trials are aggregated together by a scientist, who then analyzes said research studies to provide a comprehensive overview of the current evidence on the topic. 

**13 reports, 26 basic research studies, and 12 clinical trail reviews later...** Simone has identified the following key findings: 
1. Eating both green & gold kiwifruits improves upper GI symptoms 
2. Regular consumption of green kiwifruit reduces abdominal discomfort and pain
3. Kiwifruit intake may improve upper GI symptoms through multiple mechanisms involving the microbiota-gut-brainaxis 

Tune in to this episode where Simone shares her tedious and rewarding experience of conducting her systematic review on Kiwifruits effects on Upper GI symptoms! Don't miss out at the ending where Simone discusses the various proposed mechanisms of Kiwifruit on Relief of Upper GI symptoms-- 
- **Actinidin** : An enzyme that likely aids in digestion via increasing the gastric emptying rate 
- **Kissper** (Not Kippers!): A peptide found that play a role in reducing inflammation 
- **Ulcers**: 1 study showed rats with reduced ulcers with kiwifruit consumption?! 
- **Fermentation and the GI Microbiota**: 13 studies suggest kiwi-speciifc fiber may have prebiotic-like effects that encourages production of **beneficial** fermentation products. 

Join us on [episode 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMkexT3Xv6M&t=3754s) in this 3-part series to learn about the valuable efforts and insight Simone has brought to the comprehensive and transparent search of literature on Kiwifruit Effects on digestive health!
