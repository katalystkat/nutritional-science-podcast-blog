Hey there! Welcome to [**Episode 1**](https://www.youtube.com/katalystkat) of our nutritional science podcast! 

Before we jump into the **juicy** topics, episode 1 will bring you to the foundations of research studies. In fact, have you ever heard of the hierarchy of scientific proof? It's a way of organizing the different types of evidence that can be used to support scientific claims, with the most reliable forms of evidence at the peak and the least reliable at the base.  

At the top of the hierarchy is evidence from well-conducted randomized controlled trials (RCT), which are conidered the gold standard of scientific evidence. Thes studies involve randomly assigning subjects to different treatment groups and comparing the outcomes, which helps to eliminate bias and accurately measure the effects of the treatment being studied. 

Below RCT's are observational studies, which include observing and collecting data on subjects without randomly assigning them to treatment groups. While these studies can provide useful information, they are generally considered less reliable than RCT's because they are more prone to bias and confounding factors! 

Then at the base of this hierarchy, are **expert opinions** and **anectodal evidence** (surprise surprise!). These are information that are based on the personal experiences and obsevations of individual experts. While these types of evidence can be interesting and informative, they are generally considered the least reliable form of scientific evidene because they are subjective and not basd on rigorous scientific methods! 

It is important to keep in mind that no single study or piece of evidence is ever considered conclusive on its own. Instead, scientific evidence is evaluated as a whole, with the highest level of evidence being given the most weight. By using the hierarchy of scientific proof, we can more accurately evaluate the reliability and strength of scientific claims and make informed decisions based on the best available evidence.
